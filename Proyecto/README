This is the README for the image processing library, imagelib.

You can find the source code of this library in our repository in

You need a few dependencies in order to use imagelib.

First you need a c++ compiler g++. In case that you don't have it:
	$ sudo apt-get install g++

Also you'll need make to comile automatically this library and our documentation
	$ sudo apt-get install make

For our documentation, you'll need doxygen and some latex-dependecies
	$ sudo apt-get install doxygen texlive texlive-pictures pdflatex

Now you're ready to compile our library and generate our documentation. Just enter 
the Project directory and execute make all or make.
